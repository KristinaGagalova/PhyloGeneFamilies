# PhyloGeneFamilies
Cluster gene families and display phylogeny tree by species

The software is based on [ProGraphMSA](https://github.com/acg-team/ProGraphMSA) and R - ggtree.

Dependencies:
T-Reks (java) - wget http://bioinfo.montp.cnrs.fr/t-reks/T-Reks.jar
TRUST: Tracking Repeats Using Transitivity and Significance - wget http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/trustwww/trust.tgz


## Installation
Download the GitHub repo and add the ```src``` directory to your PATH (linux users). The directory contains the necessary software and scripts to run.
